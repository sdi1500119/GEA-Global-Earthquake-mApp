### Visit [Demo page](https://global-earthquake-mapp.vercel.app "Desktop version").
#### This desktop application uses the USGS (U.S. Geological Survey - [USGS.gov](https://https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/) free API to display real-time seismic activity worldwide on a map. Earthquakes are displayed differently, depending on their magnitude, and there is a filter based on the time they occurred.
